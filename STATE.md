# STATE.md — phase-by-phase state of the unattended PA→P5 run

_Every claim here is backed by a tool result from the run session. Live-API items are
UNVERIFIED, no exceptions._

## PA — Audit (COMPLETE)

**Built:** `AUDIT.md`; git repository initialised with Phase 0 committed as-found.

**Deviations:** none. No conflicts with LOCKED sections found (see AUDIT.md §5 for the
call-time vs construction key-gate note and its resolution — adapter wraps, spike unmodified).

**Verified and how:**
- Repo tree, absence of scaffold/git/tests: `find`/`ls`/`git rev-parse` output.
- Absence of key material: `find . -name ".env*"` → nothing; `grep -rl "AIza"` over
  `*.ts`/`*.md` → nothing.
- `resolvePlaces.ts` read in full; port mapping written against its actual exports.

**Done-check:** AUDIT.md exists. Later phases reference it where reality differed from the
handover (framework-does-not-exist: P1 scaffolds greenfield per AUDIT.md §2).
