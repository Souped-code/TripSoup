# STATE.md — phase-by-phase state of the unattended PA→P5 run

_Every claim here is backed by a tool result from the run session. Live-API items are
UNVERIFIED, no exceptions._

## PA — Audit (COMPLETE — fresh-context review: 0 blocking, 3 minor findings, wording fixed)

**Built:** `AUDIT.md`; git repository initialised (first commit bundles Phase 0 as-found with
the PA documents — committed `resolvePlaces.ts` matches the working tree, proving Phase 0
unmodified).

**Deviations:** none. No conflicts with LOCKED sections found (see AUDIT.md §5 for the
call-time vs construction key-gate note and its resolution — adapter wraps, spike unmodified).

**Verified and how:**
- Repo tree, absence of scaffold/git/tests: `find`/`ls`/`git rev-parse` output.
- Absence of key material: `find . -name ".env*"` → nothing; `grep -rl "AIza"` over
  `*.ts`/`*.md` → nothing at audit time (re-running it now matches AUDIT.md/STATE.md only,
  because they quote the pattern — no actual key material).
- `resolvePlaces.ts` read in full; port mapping written against its actual exports.

**Done-check:** AUDIT.md exists. Later phases reference it where reality differed from the
handover (framework-does-not-exist: P1 scaffolds greenfield per AUDIT.md §2).

## P1 — mapsProvider port, fixture adapter, real adapter, cache (COMPLETE)

**Built:** `src/lib/maps/` — `types.ts` (port interface adapted to the spike's shape per
AUDIT.md §3; `Settings` with LOCKED defaults walkMax 10 / driveOverhead 10 / detour 1.3 /
80 m/min / thresholds 9 & 15), `walkEstimator.ts` (pure, not on the port),
`matrixSource.ts` (cache keyed `(from,to,mode)` + per-origin batching, chunk 25, standalone so
it tests with a stub fetcher), `fixtureCity.ts` ("Casterbridge", 20 stops, metric-formula drive
matrix — triangle inequality by construction, ceil-preserved), `fixtureAdapter.ts`,
`realAdapter.ts` (constructor throws without `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`; resolution = Phase 0
module unmodified; matrix = Routes API `computeRouteMatrix`, driving only, through the shared
cache). Scaffold: package.json, tsconfig, jest, minimal Next app shell (placeholder pages).

**Deviations:** none from LOCKED sections. Framework scaffolded greenfield per AUDIT.md §2.

**Verified and how (tool output this session):**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0.
- `npx jest` → 4 suites, **25/25 passed**: cache hit never re-fetches (warm call = zero
  fetcher calls); batching correct (per-origin, 25-per-request chunking: 30 dests → 25+5;
  4 stops → 4 requests not 12); incremental stop fetches only new pairs; triangle inequality
  exhaustive over all 20³ fixture triples; walk estimator goldens (1° = 111,194.93 m;
  800 m → 13 min) including exact-threshold boundary (10.0 min at walkMax 10 → eligible,
  10.0016 → not); fixture resolution by id/name/suffix with legible failures; §3 jest guard —
  no test file imports the real adapter.

**UNVERIFIED (live-API, by design — no key in the run environment):**
- Real adapter against the live Routes API (request shape, `duration` parsing, billed count) —
  LIVE-CHECKLIST step 2.
- Phase-0-through-port resolution against live Google — LIVE-CHECKLIST step 1.
- The real adapter's key-gate throw is asserted by code inspection only: §3's jest guard
  forbids tests importing the real adapter, so there is deliberately no unit test constructing
  it. Behaviour is two lines (read env, throw) — reviewed, not executed.

**Fresh-context review:** 0 blocking, 2 minor — guard regex hardened for dynamic import();
§3's "cached in persistence" is satisfied at P1 by the injectable `MatrixCache` interface with
an in-memory default; binding the real adapter's cache to actual persistence happens with the
provider factory (P4/P5) and its live behaviour is LIVE-CHECKLIST step 2.

## P2 — Solver core (COMPLETE)

**Built:** `src/lib/solver/` — `types.ts` (Segment with anchor boundaries as inputs —
structurally immovable; `SolveResult` = ok | infeasible | rejected), `effectiveMatrix.ts`
(§2 decide-then-offer: eligible legs retain BOTH times `{mode, walkMin, driveMin, chosenBy}`;
ineligible pairs drive with `walkMin: null`; schedule math always uses active-mode effective
time, drive = raw + overhead), `solver.ts` (pure `optimize(segment, matrix, settings)`:
lexicographic exhaustive ≤ maxExhaustive; NN seed + 2-opt for 10–15 labelled `heuristic`;
> 15 rejected with the §2 actionable message; ties lexicographic by stop id; structured
infeasibility naming `anchor-start:<id>` or `day-window` and the minutes missed).

**Deviations:** none. One interpretation call recorded: §2 says "ineligible pairs always
drive at raw drive time" and also "schedule math always uses … drive = drive + overhead".
Read as: "raw" distinguishes the matrix entry from the walk-comparison value; overhead applies
to every drive leg in schedule math (the hail/load/park rationale applies to any drive).
Not a LOCKED conflict — the two sentences compose under this reading.

**Verified and how (tool output this session):**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0. `npx jest` → 8 suites, **51/51 passed**, including:
- Goldens: hand-computed line/corridor segments (exact orders, exact arrive/depart minutes),
  tie broken lexicographically, empty-segment boundary feasibility, and a fixture-city
  differential golden (solver order == independent in-test brute force over effective times).
- Comparison-rule goldens verbatim from §5: walk 5 vs drive 10 → walk; walk 8 vs drive 4 +
  overhead 10 → walk; beyond walkMax → drive regardless (walkMin null); exact-walkMax
  boundary → eligible; tie walk-vs-drive+overhead → walk, deterministic.
- Property tests (fast-check, 100 runs each): every stop exactly once; anchors never move
  (start/end boundary arithmetic + end arrival ≤ endBy); infeasible ⇒ named constraint +
  positive violation; input stop-order invariance. Heuristic regime (n 10–12, 25 runs):
  once-each + boundaries + label.
- Determinism across 100 runs: identical results, exhaustive AND heuristic regimes.
- Caps: 9 → optimal, 10 → heuristic, 15 → heuristic, 16 → rejected (actionable message);
  thresholds proven to be settings (maxExhaustive 3 flips a 4-stop segment to heuristic).

## P3 — Schedule builder + feasibility surface (COMPLETE)

**Built:** `src/lib/schedule/` — `types.ts` (Day/DayStop per §4 trip shape, anchors inline;
`DayPlan` with entries {arrive, start, depart, wait}, legs carrying both times + chosenBy,
day slack), `schedule.ts` (`planDay`: splits the ordered stop list into runs at anchors,
optimizes each segment, assembles the day; `rescheduleDay`: fixed-order walk for the §2
toggle path — re-times downstream without re-ordering, fresh feasibility; `applyLegModes`:
pure mode flip, refuses ineligible walks, marks `chosenBy: "user"`; validation surface for
duplicate ids, anchors outside the day window, anchors out of chronological order).

**Deviations:** none. Design note: flexible stops belong to the segment where they sit in the
day's ordered list (between anchors, §1's "maximal run" reading).

**Verified and how (tool output this session):**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0. `npx jest` → 9 suites, **64/64 passed** (13 new), including:
- Hand-computed full-day golden (two anchors, two segments): exact arrive/start/depart/wait
  for all six stops (lunch anchor waited 50 min, show anchor 248), legs with durations,
  totalTravel 62, day slack 90; per-segment optimal orders proven against the alternative.
- Slack computation: waitMin at anchors, daySlackMin at day end.
- Heuristic label propagates from a 10-stop segment to the day plan.
- Toggle path: auto plan walks an eligible leg (walk 9 beats drive 2+10); user toggle to
  drive shifts downstream arrivals +3 without re-ordering, `chosenBy: "user"`, both times
  still offered; a toggle that breaks the day window resurfaces as a structured report
  (violatedBy 2); ineligible-walk toggles refused loudly; input matrix not mutated.
- Infeasibility surface: day-window overrun and unreachable anchors named with minutes;
  anchor-order and anchor-outside-day validation actionable.

**Note on P2 review findings (fixed here):** `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` untracked and gitignored.
Provenance correction for the record: the P1 guard-regex hardening described in the P1 entry
was committed as part of the P2 commit (72547cd), not the P1 commit.

## P4 — UI trip board + optimize + result view (COMPLETE)

**Built:**
- `src/lib/store/` — `tripStore` port (§4): `types.ts` (TripDoc `{tripId, days, settings,
  legOverrides}` — §4 sketch field names carry a `Min` suffix for unit clarity),
  `fileStore.ts` (dev + all tests), `kvStore.ts` (Vercel KV via Upstash REST protocol, plain
  fetch, no new dependency — **UNVERIFIED**, §4: provisioning is a Chris step).
- `src/lib/config.ts` — adapter/store factories: fixture whenever `MAPS_PROVIDER=fixture` OR
  no key (tests/dev can never spend); real adapter only with a key, lazily imported, its
  matrix cache file-persisted (`.cache/matrix-cache.json`) closing P1-review minor #2;
  KV store only when KV env vars exist, else file store.
- `src/lib/planService.ts` — order from the solver on the AUTO matrix, then persisted leg
  overrides re-time the fixed order (never re-order, §2); stale/ineligible overrides dropped
  at the boundary; quality survives re-timing (P3-review fix).
- API routes (`app/api/trips/…`): create, get, put (boundary-validated), `resolve`
  (server-side — key never reaches the client), `plan`.
- UI: home (`/`), trip board (`/trip/[id]`) — days, paste-to-add stops with legible failure
  panel + duplicate dedupe, per-stop duration input, anchor lock/unlock with time field,
  optimize action, result view (`src/ui/PlanView.tsx`): timeline, legs labelled walk/drive,
  eligible legs show BOTH times with a per-leg toggle, wait/slack shown, heuristic and
  infeasible and rejected states rendered; settings card exposes walkMax + driveOverheadMin.

**Deviations:** none from LOCKED sections.

**Verified and how (tool output this session):**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0. `npx jest` → 10 suites, **66/66 passed** (2 added at P3-review:
  heuristic label survives re-timing; duplicate-id throw).
- `npx playwright test` (fixture adapter, `MAPS_PROVIDER=fixture`, no key in env) →
  **5/5 passed**: (1) add stops incl. a bogus line → failure panel names it → mark anchor,
  move to 15:00 → optimize → on-screen order AND every entry's times equal a differential
  plan computed in-test from the same fixture+solver libraries; legs labelled walk/drive;
  (2) toggle an eligible walk leg → mode flips to drive, downstream entry shifts by exactly
  driveMin + overhead − walkMin, order unchanged, and the toggle persists across reload +
  re-optimize; (3) unreachable 09:10 anchor → infeasibility report with
  `anchor-start:<id>`, zero plan elements rendered; (4) 10-stop day → heuristic badge;
  (5) walkMax set to 0 forces the old-town hop to drive (live settings field).
- First e2e run failed on scenario arithmetic (three 60-min stops cannot precede a 12:00
  anchor) — the app correctly reported infeasible; the test moved the anchor to 15:00.
  Recorded here per the reporting rule; not a product bug.

**UNVERIFIED (live):** KV store adapter (no credentials, by design); real-adapter plan flow.

## P5 — Share read-only view + LIVE-CHECKLIST (COMPLETE)

**Built:** `app/share/[id]/page.tsx` — server component, fetches the doc through the
tripStore port, recomputes each day via `planTripDay` (deterministic solver ⇒ recompute
reproduces exactly what the owner saw, persisted leg toggles included), renders `PlanView`
in read-only mode (no toggles, no editing controls). `LIVE-CHECKLIST.md` finalised, six
steps ordered exactly per §6, each with what-verified-looks-like.

**Deviations:** none.

**Verified and how (tool output this session):**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0. `npx playwright test` → **6/6 passed**: the share spec builds
  a day, optimizes, toggles an eligible leg (and waits for the re-plan), then loads
  `/share/<id>` and asserts identical entry order, identical times, identical leg modes
  (toggle honoured), and zero toggle/optimize/paste controls in the share view.
- First share-spec run failed on a TEST race (owner times captured before the post-toggle
  re-plan landed; the share view was actually correct). Fixed by waiting for the toggled
  leg to render "drive" before capturing. Recorded per the reporting rule; not a product bug.

**UNVERIFIED (live):** share round-trip on a deployed app with Vercel KV from a phone —
LIVE-CHECKLIST step 5.
